# Description
* This mod makes it so that game regions scale to your level in Normal Mode, with a level cap of 17.
* Playing Normal Mode with a character whose level's higher than 17 will still result in level 17 regions.
* The Raid Boss of the game, meant to be 3 levels higher than the player, will be level 20 at most in Normal Mode.

# Changelog
## Version 1.0
